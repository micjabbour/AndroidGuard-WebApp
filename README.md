# AndroidGuard - WebApp
website and webservice for the android application [AndroidGuard](https://github.com/micjabbour/AndroidGuard-AndroidApp) (a small anti-theft android application).

The application was created while I was toying around with flask framework and various flask extensions. It does not provide any guarantee or warranty of any kind, use at your own risk.

## Setup the website:

 1. clone the repository
 
        git clone https://github.com/micjabbour/AndroidGuard-WebApp
        
 2. setup [virtualenv](https://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) to install website's dependencies (optional).
 
 3. install all required packages:
         
         pip install -r requirements.txt
         
 4. add missing configuration paramters in [config.py](AndroidGuard/config.py)
